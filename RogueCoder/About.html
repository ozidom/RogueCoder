    <p>
        This game was created for the 7 day rouguelike comp in 2013.
    </p>
    <p>
        I have used the roguebase framework I built for my entries in this years (2013) 1GAM (onegameamonth.com) comp. A lot of the ideas for this game emerged from my
        first attempt at a 7DRL last year (CyberPrisonEscape). That was a failure but taught me a lot about 7DRL's.

    Movement keys are [W,Z,S,A]  or arrow keys - click on any object or item to get its description.
     Use your laptop to send commands to prison objects. Your best advice for using your laptop is by asking other prisoners 
    about using the scripting language dominicscript. Sample code can be used  In combat each level becomes harder -
     guards on the higher levels are much harder to defeat and your health points will be lost as you loose fights to the guards.
     You start the game with 10 health points - when your health points reach 0 you are dead. Prisoners are your best friends move 
        over them in the game and they will display the subjects they have knowledge for. Click on the subject header to display the 
        knowledge.
